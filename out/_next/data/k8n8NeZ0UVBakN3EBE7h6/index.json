It is a holistic way of addressing challenges that takes into account the whole system in which the problem exists, rather than just its isolated parts. Design thinking can be applied to a wide range of fields, including software development, product design, and business strategy. The goal of design thinking is to come up with innovative solutions that are both functional and desirable for the users.\n\nI begin by empathizing with the people I am designing for. This might involve conducting user research to gain insights into their needs and experiences.\nNext, I define the problem I am trying to solve by synthesizing the insights I gathered in the empathize step and creating a specific, actionable problem statement.\nThen, I generate ideas for potential solutions through brainstorming sessions or individual ideation exercises.\nI build a physical or digital prototype of my ideas in order to test and iterate on them quickly and inexpensively.\n5. Finally, I evaluate my prototypes with real users and gather feedback to inform further iteration and refinement.\n\nThroughout this process, I focus on the needs of the users and the overall goal of the project, using the design thinking process to guide my decision-making and problem-solving.\n\nIn the context of design thinking, Scrum can be useful for gathering and incorporating user feedback because it provides a structured way to manage and prioritize feedback, as well as a regular cadence for reviewing and incorporating it into the product. For example, during each sprint, a Scrum team might conduct user research or usability testing to gather feedback on the product, and then use that feedback to inform the development work for the next sprint.\n\nIn this way, Scrum can help a team apply the principles of design thinking by providing a framework for continuously gathering and incorporating user feedback in order to iteratively improve the product over time.\n\nFor the task management of this project we have used GitHub as a way to centralise the process.\n\nUser stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality that a user would like to see in a product. They are often used in agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, to capture the requirements of a project from the perspective of the end user.\n\nUsing user stories in GitHub can help your team track and manage the requirements of your project in a clear and organized way, and facilitate collaboration among team members."},{"id":2,"__component":"section.section-name","name":"frontend"},{"id":33,"__component":"shared.rich-text","body":"## FRONTEND\n\nVue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces on the web. It's known for its simplicity and flexibility, and is often used for building single page applications (SPAs) - essentially, web pages that don't require a full page reload when navigating between different routes. This means that common elements between different pages can be preserved, making for a more seamless user experience.\n\nVue.js also allows for the creation of reactive components, which means that the visual elements of the page are automatically updated whenever the underlying data model changes. This can be especially useful in situations where the data being displayed is constantly changing, as it means the page will always be up-to-date without the need for manual refresh.\n\nNuxt.js is a meta-framework built on top of Vue.js that adds additional utilities and features. It's often used in professional projects where the codebase is expected to scale, as it comes with a number of tools and features that can help make the development process more efficient.\n\nThe Vuetify plugin is a set of pre-fabricated visual components that can be easily integrated into a Vue.js project. It's designed to help developers create layouts and designs that adhere to the guidelines of Material Design 2 - a set of design principles developed by Google - without having to spend a lot of time creating custom CSS.\n\nThe Mapbox API is a tool that allows developers to add interactive maps to their web applications. It provides a number of features, including the ability to customize the look and feel of the map, add markers and other data points, and allow users to interact with the map in various ways.\n\nService Workers are functions that can run in the background of a web application, even when the application itself is not actively being used. They can be used for tasks like listening for push notifications or performing other background tasks that need to be completed even when the application is not open.\n\nAs for the third party modules that we will be using, Firebase PUSH notifications and SMS are services that allow developers to send notifications and texts to users of their application. Google Analytics is a tool that allows developers to track and analyze user behavior on their web application.\n\nTo communicate with our backend, Axios is a library for making HTTP requests, which can be especially useful when building a RESTful service. Socket.io is a library that allows for bidirectional communication between a web application and a server, which can be useful for tasks like real-time messaging. Finally, passport.js is a tool that simplifies the authentication process by allowing developers to use various methods for verifying users."},{"id":13,"__component":"section.section-name","name":"Backend"},{"id":34,"__component":"shared.rich-text","body":"## BACKEND\n\nOur backend will act as a go-between for the frontend and the various services and databases we have. To do this, we will use Node.js, a popular environment for running JavaScript that's often used to implement web servers.\n\nThe frontend has multiple ways of connecting to the backend, depending on its needs. While each of these functions could have its own server, we've opted for a more monolithic design in order to avoid the added complexity of a microservices-based architecture. To handle HTTP requests from the frontend, we'll use Express.js, a library that makes it easy to develop servers using the REST protocol. While it was also an option to use GraphQL, we chose REST because it offers more flexibility and ease of development in case we need to scale to a microservices system.\n\nFor socket connections, we'll use the module on the server. This will allow us to keep track of the clients currently subscribed and ensure they're updated with notifications and messages in the chat. To manage authentication, we'll use Passport.js, a library that allows us to unify the authentication process and easily add new methods if needed. By default, it uses JWT tokens, which have the advantage of not requiring the server to store any client information.\n\nTo communicate with the database, we'll use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) called Prisma. This allows us to use object-oriented programming instead of SQL queries to interact with the database. Prisma uses TypeScript by default, which gives us the added benefits of an object-oriented and typed language when making database queries. This helps to improve organization and development in the project.\n\nAdditionally, we'll need to connect our server to a static file storage provider. To do this, we'll use the AWS.js library to communicate with our S3 storage service. Finally, we'll use Sendgrid to send emails to our users, mainly for account verification or password recovery."},{"id":14,"__component":"section.section-name","name":"Database"},{"id":35,"__component":"shared.rich-text","body":"## DATABASE\n\nDesigning our database was an important step in the development of our platform. To ensure we were able to manage large amounts of data and handle many interconnected queries, we looked to popular social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram for inspiration. These platforms often use a combination of relational and non-relational databases depending on their needs. Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are typically used when a system needs to scale or when consultation times are a concern. On the other hand, relational databases are used when there are highly interconnected elements, like users and their posts.\n\nSince our project is a minimum viable product and we are following an agile development methodology, we prioritized getting the project up and running quickly so we could get feedback from users. For this reason, we decided to use a single relational database to reduce complexity in our backend. However, as the number of active users increases, we may need to scale certain functionalities and will consider migration to a NoSQL database as a solution. To detect the need to scale, we will monitor our application and database for changes in loading times or potential errors.\n\nWe chose postgreSQL as our relational database because it is equipped to handle geolocated data. We also utilized the PostGIS extension to provide specialized data types and functions for spatial data. In addition to structured data storage, our platform needs a place to store static resources like images, videos, and audio files, as well as user profile images. To meet this need, we are using a cloud service like Amazon Web Services S3."},{"id":1,"__component":"shared.recommendation","author":"Andriu Garcia","content":"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
