Their forte lies in identifying, narrating, and linking brand stories that distinguish them from the competition. \n\nCollaborating with the [Studio Vi](https://viamsterdam.com/) team, Zandbeek enlisted our expertise to develop a new website that aligned with their fresh corporate identity. Our aim was to deliver an easy-to-use, welcoming interface with cutting-edge user experience (UX) features."},{"id":3,"__component":"shared.external","url":"https://zandbeek.com/","name":"Zandbeek"},{"id":28,"__component":"section.section-name","name":"Horizontal"},{"id":29,"__component":"shared.rich-text","body":"## Horizontal Experience\n\nThe key feature of this page's design is the horizontal scroll, which directs the user's attention towards the project stories that Zandbeek wants to showcase. To achieve this, we utilized Locomotive Scroll instead of the default browser scroll. \n\nThis provides us with greater control over the scroll's performance across all browsers, including the ability to program smooth scrolling, change the position of elements, and create parallax effects by adjusting the friction of individual elements."},{"id":4,"__component":"shared.video","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpgwjrkr/video/upload/v1679925809/zandbeek-desktop_ze6rgu.mp4"},{"id":29,"__component":"section.section-name","name":"Scroll"},{"id":43,"__component":"shared.rich-text","body":"## Smooth Scrolling\nWe implemented smooth scrolling across all pages, creating a seamless and polished user experience. This was further enhanced by input animations that appear when elements come into view. Together, these features create a more enjoyable browsing experience for the user, while also enabling lazy loading of elements that are not yet on the screen."},{"id":5,"__component":"shared.video","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpgwjrkr/video/upload/v1679925809/zandbeek-mobile_meizbx.mp4"},{"id":30,"__component":"section.section-name","name":"Transitions"},{"id":44,"__component":"shared.rich-text","body":"### Clean Transitions\n\nWe wanted to create a seamless transition for users as they navigate between projects. To achieve this, we used the main project image as a connecting element. When entering a project, we made the last frame of the main page and the first frame of the project page the same full-screen image. \n\nThis approach creates a fluid, continuous experience for the user, even though there is a complete change in the underlying page structure. The result is a smooth and uninterrupted browsing experience that enhances the user's engagement with the content."},{"id":6,"__component":"shared.video","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dkpgwjrkr/video/upload/v1679928409/zandbeek-transition_bhkfl0.mp4"}],"technologies":{"data":[{"id":5,"attributes":{"backgroundColor":"#56a819","name":"GSAP","createdAt":"2022-10-21T20:36:01.956Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-18T12:33:45.390Z","publishedAt":"2022-10-21T20:38:56.259Z","type":"frontend","icon":{"data":{"id":66,"attributes":{"name":"logo-man.svg","alternativeText":"logo-man.svg","caption":"logo-man.svg","width":307,"height":356,"formats":null,"hash":"logo_man_da0ff02dbf","ext":".svg","mime":"image/svg+xml","size":23.59,"url":"/uploads/logo_man_da0ff02dbf.svg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-01-18T12:26:58.217Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-18T12:26:58.217Z"}}}}},{"id":6,"attributes":{"backgroundColor":"#30353a","name":"Wordpress CMS","createdAt":"2022-10-21T20:36:44.872Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-21T20:38:59.544Z","publishedAt":"2022-10-21T20:38:59.542Z","type":"frontend","icon":{"data":null}}},{"id":15,"attributes":{"backgroundColor":"#155994","name":"JQuery","createdAt":"2023-01-19T09:51:29.587Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T09:51:39.068Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-19T09:51:39.067Z","type":"frontend","icon":{"data":{"id":77,"attributes":{"name":"70142.png","alternativeText":"70142.png","caption":"70142.png","width":280,"height":280,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_70142.png","hash":"thumbnail_70142_938dfb4da0","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":156,"height":156,"size":8.99,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_70142_938dfb4da0.png"}},"hash":"70142_938dfb4da0","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":8.03,"url":"/uploads/70142_938dfb4da0.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-01-19T09:50:50.952Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T09:50:50.952Z"}}}}},{"id":16,"attributes":{"backgroundColor":"#a7517d","name":"SASS","createdAt":"2023-01-19T09:58:05.037Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T09:59:03.774Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-19T09:59:03.773Z","type":"frontend","icon":{"data":{"id":78,"attributes":{"name":"sass.png","alternativeText":"sass.png","caption":"sass.png","width":512,"height":512,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_sass.png","hash":"thumbnail_sass_e3ea343957","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":156,"height":156,"size":14.86,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_sass_e3ea343957.png"},"small":{"name":"small_sass.png","hash":"small_sass_e3ea343957","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":500,"height":500,"size":85.71,"url":"/uploads/small_sass_e3ea343957.png"}},"hash":"sass_e3ea343957","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":31.23,"url":"/uploads/sass_e3ea343957.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-01-19T09:57:46.047Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T09:57:46.047Z"}}}}}]}}}],"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[project]","query":{"project":"olimaps"},"buildId":"is3m0Wt0L76noGPRyvbsU","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
